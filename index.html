                    <p> Hello, my name is Lindsay and I am a software engineer. I am looking for a position with your company to further develop my skills in software development.
                    I started this journey in August of 2018 when I started learning html,
                    css and python. It invigorated me the way that coding teaches you the right way to think, and the possibilities
                    are endless to what you can build with just a text editor, your mind and google. From there I coded mostly python and learned the basics, of course I
                    hated CSS but who doesn't? I then decided to take the next step and enroll in a coding program with UC Davis
                    Continuing and Professional Education to learn much more than I already have. I wanted to learn it all, full
                    stack development so that I could make my ideas come alive and create my own websites and programs. It was 6
                    months of intense learning from one language to the next but the focus was on the logic and concepts behind
                    these languages so that no matter what is thrown at me I am confident I can figure it out. I am ready to dive in and bring value to your company and its projects given the opportunity.

                    <p>    
                    Here are a few traits that differentiate me from other job candidates and make me such an excellent developer:

                These are just a few examples of why I am the best candidate for the position and I hope to hear from you in
                the future. The following are languages and concepts I have worked with previously and am quite familiar with. Please also visit my portfolio page and check out my work!
